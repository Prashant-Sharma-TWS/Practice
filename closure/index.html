    <h3>What are IIFE's?</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Ans:</b> IIFE's are immediately invoked function expression. So, when
      you don't want to store the function scope and you only have to execute a
      function once you use IIFE's.

    <h3>What is currying?</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Ans:</b> Currying is a advanced technique of working with functions, it
      basically transforms the function calling from multiple argument passing
      to a sequence of function with single argument.

      Explain some areas where you have seen currying being implemented in React
      / other libraries?
    </h3>
    <p>
      <b>Ans:</b> examples of currying are (when clicking a button, the event
      passed is using currying), (how we use props in react).

      click both the button to see that they both do the same thing but in a
      different way.
